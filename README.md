# Walk Safe: A Smarter Way to Navigate

## About
  - Walk Safe is a mapping application designed to help users find the **safest**, **healthiest**, and **greenest routes** while walking. By integrating various data sources, the app aims to make walking not only safer but also more enjoyable and environmentally friendly.
  - "Walk Safe" is a project within the framework of EEA M100 Cities - Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities: Planning, Piloting, Inspiring, an initiative aimed at strengthening the capacity of three municipalities in Romania to achieve climate neutrality.
  - The "Walk Safe" application is an innovative tool that enhances pedestrian safety and urban environmental quality by leveraging artificial intelligence and local data. With the support of data and expertise provided by 5 master's students from the Faculty of Geography, along with 2 other colleagues, we integrated advanced technologies to analyze and recommend walking routes optimized for safety, sustainability, and health, utilizing algorithms such as:
    - A*
    - Ant Colony Optimization
